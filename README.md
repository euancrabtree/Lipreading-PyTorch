# Lipreading With Machine Learning In PyTorch
A PyTorch implementation of the models described in [Combining Residual Networks with LSTMs for Lipreading]  by T. Stafylakis and G. Tzimiropoulos. Adapted from the [Torch7 code].

## Usage
 - Install [Python 3].
 - Clone the repository.
 - Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install project dependencies.
 - to use, run  `python3 main.py`.

## Dependencies
 - [Python 3] to run the program
 - [PyTorch] for tensors, network definition and backprop
 - [ImageIO] to load video clips
 - [NumPy] to visualize individual layers
